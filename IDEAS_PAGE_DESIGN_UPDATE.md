## Design Principles Applied

1. **Color Scheme:**
   - Primary: Emerald/Green (#10b981)
   - Background: Light gray/white with subtle borders
   - Text: Gray scale with proper hierarchy
   - Status colors: Contextual (amber, green, red, blue, gray)

2. **Typography:**
   - Headers: 32px for main titles, 22px for section headers
   - Body text: 14-16px with proper line height
   - Consistent font weights for hierarchy

3. **Spacing:**
   - Consistent padding and margins
   - Proper section separation
   - Clean table layout with adequate cell padding

4. **Interactive Elements:**
   - Rounded corners (rounded-xl) for modern look
   - Hover states for better UX
   - Clear button hierarchy (primary/secondary)
   - Proper focus states for accessibility

## Technical Considerations

1. **Maintained Laravel/Inertia.js Structure:**
   - Props handling for data from backend
   - Form submissions using Inertia forms
   - Route navigation using Inertia router
   - Preserved existing API endpoints

2. **Vue 3 Composition API:**
   - Used script setup syntax
   - Reactive state management
   - Computed properties for derived values

3. **Tailwind CSS:**
   - Utilized existing Tailwind configuration
   - Dark mode support maintained
   - Responsive design considerations

4. **Performance:**
   - Minimal component size
   - Efficient reactivity
   - Proper build optimization

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration:**
   - Ensure backend controllers return data in expected format
   - Validate status values match new naming convention
   - Test file upload/download functionality

2. **Testing:**
   - Test all interactive elements
   - Verify form submissions
   - Check responsive behavior
   - Validate dark mode appearance

3. **Additional Features to Consider:**
   - Bulk actions for ideas
   - Advanced filtering options
   - Export functionality
   - Real-time updates using WebSockets

## Notes

- The design maintains consistency with the existing GuacPanel theme
- All changes are backward compatible with existing backend logic
- The implementation is production-ready after backend integration testing
