Hackathon Management System – Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Draft Idea
The idea of the system is to manage an environment-focused hackathon held in Buraidah City under the supervision of the Saudi Ministry of Agriculture (Qassim Branch) and the Qassim Emirate.
The Hackathon System is a web platform that includes:
* A landing page.

* A page describing the hackathon.

* A page for prizes.

* A page to showcase workshops, seminars, and lectures held during the hackathon.

* A page that explains the hackathon tracks.

The system allows users to register either as:
   * Team Leader, or

   * Team Member.

After registration, the Team Leader submits the idea they want to participate with under one of the hackathon tracks.
      * Registration and idea submission are time-limited. Once the deadline ends, registration and idea submissions close.

      * The hackathon has a new edition every year, with different start and end dates for registration.

      * After submission, the idea goes to the track supervisor, who evaluates, accepts, or rejects it.

      * Once accepted or rejected, an email notification is sent to the Team Leader, and the result appears when logging in (for the Team Leader or any team member).

      * Team Members can either join a team by invitation from the leader or by registering and requesting to join a team. The Team Leader then receives a notification to accept or reject the request.

The track supervisor has the ability to:
         * Accept, reject, or request modifications for an idea.

         * Ask for additional files or details.

         * Provide comments, which are visible to the whole team.

When an idea is accepted, the supervisor can also send notifications to the team, such as:
            * Scheduling an online or in-person meeting.

            * Informing them of next steps and upcoming requirements.

The platform also allows visitors (non-participants) to register for seminars or workshops held during the hackathon if they are interested.
               * Registration for workshops requires: Name, Email, Phone Number, National ID/Residence Number.

               * After registration, an email with a barcode is sent for attendance verification.

               * Attendance is recorded by scanning the barcode using any mobile device authorized for attendance tracking.

               * Attendance can be counted per session or in total across all events.

Visitors, Team Leaders, and Team Members can all register for workshops.
                  * Multiple workshops can be registered for.

The platform includes a news section with:
                     * Title, description, image, and publication date.

                     * Each news item can be automatically posted to Twitter (X).

The system is:
                        * Responsive across all devices.

                        * Supports Arabic and English.

                        * Supports Dark Mode.
