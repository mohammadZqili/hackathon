# Project Status Documentation

## Completed Features:

*   **Database Schema:** A comprehensive database schema has been defined in the migrations, covering all the core entities of the application like users, hackathons, ideas, teams, workshops, news, and their relationships.
*   **User Roles & Permissions (Initial Setup):** The `web.php` routes file defines route groups for different user roles (system_admin, hackathon_admin, track_supervisor, team_leader, team_member, visitor), indicating that a role-based access control system is in place, likely using a package like `spatie/laravel-permission`.
*   **API Endpoints (Basic):** The `api.php` routes file has basic endpoints for workshop barcode verification, attendance marking, and notification management. A health check endpoint is also present.
*   **Frontend Scaffolding (Inertia.js):** The project is set up to use Inertia.js with Vue.js. The `web.php` file shows that routes are rendering Inertia pages, and the file structure suggests that Vue components are organized by user role.
*   **Core Models:** Eloquent models for all the database tables have been created in the `app/Models` directory.
*   **Basic Policies:** Policies for `Idea`, `Team`, and `Workshop` have been created, which is a good foundation for authorization logic.

## Partially Implemented Features:

*   **User Authentication:** While routes are set up with `auth:sanctum` middleware, the actual implementation of registration, login, and profile management is likely in the "to-do" state, as indicated by the `tasks.md` file.
*   **Admin Panel:** Routes for the admin panel exist, but they currently point to placeholder Inertia components. The backend logic for managing ideas, teams, tracks, workshops, news, and reports is not yet implemented.
*   **Supervisor Dashboard:** Similar to the admin panel, routes for the supervisor dashboard are defined, but the backend logic for idea evaluation is missing.
*   **Team Lead/Member Dashboards:** Routes are in place, but the core functionalities like team creation, idea submission, and collaboration features need to be implemented.
*   **Workshop Management:** While the database schema and some API endpoints are ready, the full implementation of workshop creation, registration, and attendance tracking is incomplete.

## Not Implemented Features:

*   **Public Pages:** The public-facing pages (landing page, about, prizes, tracks) are not yet implemented.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** This security feature is mentioned in the requirements but not yet implemented.
*   **File Uploads with Antivirus Scan:** The mechanism for handling file uploads, especially with security scans, is not yet in place.
*   **Notifications (Email/SMS):** While there are API routes for notifications, the actual sending of emails and SMS messages for events like idea status changes or workshop registrations is not implemented.
*   **Twitter Integration:** The functionality to automatically post news to Twitter is not yet implemented.
*   **Multi-language Support:** The system is intended to be bilingual (Arabic/English), but the implementation for this is not yet present.
*   **Dark Mode:** The dark mode feature is not yet implemented.
*   **Reporting and Statistics:** The generation of reports and statistics for hackathon editions is not yet implemented.
