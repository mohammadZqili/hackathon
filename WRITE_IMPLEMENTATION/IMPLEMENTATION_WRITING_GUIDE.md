## 💡 TIPS FOR WRITING THE PLAN

1. **Be Specific**: Don't write "create form" - specify exact fields, validation, and behavior
2. **Include Code**: Write actual code snippets, not descriptions
3. **Consider Arabic**: Every text should have Arabic/English pairs
4. **Think Mobile**: Every layout should be responsive
5. **Plan Errors**: Define what happens when things go wrong
6. **Use Existing**: Maximize reuse of GuacPanel components

## 📊 EXAMPLE OF GOOD VS BAD PLANNING

### ❌ BAD: Vague
"Create team management page"

### ✅ GOOD: Specific
"Create TeamManage.vue at resources/js/Pages/TeamLeader/Team/Manage.vue with:
- DataTable showing members (name, email, status, joined_date)
- Invite button opening modal with email/national_id input
- Remove member button with confirmation dialog
- Props: team (Object), members (Array)
- Emits: memberInvited, memberRemoved"
