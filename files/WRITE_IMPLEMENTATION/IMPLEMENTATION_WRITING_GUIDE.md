## 💡 TIPS FOR WRITING THE PLAN

1. **Be Specific**: Don't write "create form" - specify exact fields, validation, and behavior
2. **Include Code**: Write actual code snippets, not descriptions
3. **Consider Arabic**: Every text should have Arabic/English pairs
4. **Think Mobile**: Every layout should be responsive
5. **Plan Errors**: Define what happens when things go wrong
6. **Use Existing**: Maximize reuse of GuacPanel components

## 📊 EXAMPLE OF GOOD VS BAD PLANNING

### ❌ BAD: Vague
"Create team management page"

### ✅ GOOD: Specific (From Our Actual STEP_3)
```markdown
### Page: Team Leader Team Management
**File Path:** resources/js/Pages/TeamLeader/Team/Show.vue
**Route Name:** team-leader.team.show
**URL Pattern:** /team-leader/team
**Controller:** App\Http\Controllers\TeamLeader\TeamController@show
**Middleware:** ['auth', 'role:team_leader']

**UI Components:**
- DataTable: Members list (name, email, status, joined_date, actions)
- Modal: InviteMemberModal with email/national_id input
- Modal: RemoveMemberConfirmModal
- Card: Team details (name, code, track, created_date)
- Badge: Team status (active/inactive)
- Button: Invite Member (opens modal)
- Button: Remove Member (per row, opens confirm)

**Validation Rules:**
- email: required_without:national_id|email|exists:users,email
- national_id: required_without:email|digits:10|exists:users,national_id
```

### ❌ BAD: Generic Workflow
"User creates team and invites members"

### ✅ GOOD: Detailed Workflow (From Our Actual STEP_4)
```markdown
### WORKFLOW: Team Leader Creates Team

**Steps:**
1. Team Leader logs in → Redirected to /team-leader/dashboard
2. Clicks "Create Team" button (visible only if no team exists)
3. System checks: has_team? → If yes, show error "Already have team"
4. Shows team creation form with fields:
   - team_name (required, unique, max:100)
   - team_description (optional, max:500)
   - track_id (required, dropdown from active tracks)
5. Submits form → POST /api/team-leader/team
6. System validates:
   - Team name not taken in current hackathon
   - Track exists and registration open
   - User doesn't already lead a team
7. Creates team record with ULID
8. Sets leader as first member (role='leader')
9. Generates unique team code (6 chars)
10. Sends confirmation email with team code
11. Redirects to /team-leader/team/show

**Database Changes:**
- teams: INSERT (id, name, description, leader_id, track_id, code)
- team_members: INSERT (team_id, user_id, role='leader', status='active')
- audit_logs: INSERT (action='team.created')

**Error Scenarios:**
- Duplicate name: "اسم الفريق مستخدم بالفعل / Team name already taken"
- No track selected: "يجب اختيار المسار / Please select a track"
- Registration closed: "انتهت فترة التسجيل / Registration period ended"
```
