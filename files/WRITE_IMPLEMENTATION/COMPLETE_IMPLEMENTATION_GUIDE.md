## 🚨 CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### 1. Database Relationships Check:
```php
// Before creating any page, verify these relationships exist:
- User -> Team (leader and member)
- Team -> Idea (one-to-one)
- Idea -> Track (belongs to)
- User -> WorkshopRegistration
- Workshop -> Speaker/Organization (many-to-many)
```

### 2. Validation Rules:
```php
// Team validation
'name' => 'required|unique:teams,name|min:3|max:50'
'description' => 'required|min:10|max:500'

// Idea validation
'title' => 'required|min:10|max:100'
'description' => 'required|min:100|max:5000'
'track_id' => 'required|exists:tracks,id'
'attachments.*' => 'file|mimes:pdf,ppt,pptx|max:15360' // 15MB
```

### 3. Permission Gates:
```php
// Add to AuthServiceProvider
Gate::define('create-team', function ($user) {
    return $user->isTeamLeader() && !$user->getCurrentTeam();
});

Gate::define('submit-idea', function ($user, $team) {
    return $user->id === $team->leader_id && !$team->idea;
});

Gate::define('review-idea', function ($user, $idea) {
    return $user->supervisedTracks->contains($idea->track_id);
});
```

### 4. API Response Format:
```php
// Consistent API responses
return response()->json([
    'success' => true,
    'message' => 'Operation successful',
    'data' => $data
], 200);
```

### 5. Frontend State Management:
```javascript
// Use Pinia stores for complex state
const useTeamStore = defineStore('team', {
    state: () => ({
        currentTeam: null,
        members: [],
        invitations: []
    }),
    actions: {
        async fetchTeam() { /* ... */ },
        async inviteMember(email) { /* ... */ }
    }
})
```

## 📱 RESPONSIVE BREAKPOINTS

All pages must work on:
```css
/* Mobile First Approach */
/* Default: Mobile < 640px */
/* Tablet: sm:640px md:768px lg:1024px */
/* Desktop: xl:1280px 2xl:1536px */

/* Example component classes */
class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 gap-4"
```

---

## 🔐 SECURITY CHECKLIST

Before deployment:
```
□ CSRF protection enabled
□ Rate limiting on forms (5 attempts/minute)
□ File upload validation (type, size, virus scan)
□ SQL injection prevention (use Eloquent)
□ XSS protection (escape output)
□ Permission checks on all routes
□ Audit logging for sensitive actions
□ 2FA optional for admins
□ Secure password requirements
□ Session timeout configuration
```

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Issues:

1. **Route not found**: Check route names in web.php match Inertia links
2. **Permission denied**: Verify role middleware and Gates
3. **Data not showing**: Check Eloquent relationships and eager loading
4. **Arabic text broken**: Ensure UTF-8 encoding and RTL CSS
5. **QR scanner not working**: Check HTTPS and camera permissions
6. **Emails not sending**: Verify SMTP settings in .env
7. **File upload failing**: Check storage permissions and PHP limits

This guide will help you implement systematically. Start with Phase 1 and mark progress as you complete each section.
