# Implementation Summary: HackathonAdmin & TrackSupervisor Roles

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Shared Controller Architecture**
- Created base controllers in `app/Http/Controllers/Base/`:
  - `TeamController.php` - Shared team management with role-based filtering
  - `IdeaController.php` - Shared idea management with role-based filtering
- These controllers automatically filter data based on user role:
  - **System Admin**: No restrictions, sees all data
  - **Hackathon Admin**: Limited to their assigned edition
  - **Track Supervisor**: Limited to their supervised tracks

### 2. **Role-Specific Routes**
- **HackathonAdmin Routes** (`routes/hackathon-admin.php`):
  - Dashboard
  - Teams, Ideas, Tracks, Workshops management
  - News, Check-ins, Reports
  - All filtered to their edition

- **TrackSupervisor Routes** (`routes/track-supervisor.php`):
  - Dashboard
  - Teams & Ideas (filtered to supervised tracks)
  - Track-specific reports

### 3. **Shared Vue Components**
- Created reusable components in `resources/js/Components/Shared/`:
  - `DataTable.vue` - Reusable table component
  - `SearchBar.vue` - Search component with theme integration  
  - `PageHeader.vue` - Consistent page headers

### 4. **Shared Vue Pages**
- Created shared pages in `resources/js/Pages/Shared/`:
  - Teams management pages
  - Ideas management pages
  - These pages adapt based on user role via `viewPrefix` prop

### 5. **Dashboard Controllers**
- `HackathonAdmin/DashboardController.php` - Edition-specific statistics
- `TrackSupervisor/DashboardController.php` - Track-specific statistics

## 🚀 How It Works

### Intelligent Role-Based System
1. **Single Codebase**: Same controllers and views for all roles
2. **Automatic Filtering**: Data automatically filtered based on user role
3. **Dynamic UI**: Pages adapt their titles and descriptions based on role
4. **Permission-Based**: Uses Spatie permissions for access control

### Data Scoping
```php
// In Base Controllers
if ($user->hasRole('hackathon-admin')) {
    $query->where('edition_id', $user->edition_id);
}

if ($user->hasRole('track-supervisor')) {
    $query->whereIn('track_id', $user->supervisedTracks->pluck('id'));
}
```

## 📋 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Create Test Users
```bash
# In MySQL or database client
INSERT INTO users (name, email, password, edition_id, created_at, updated_at) 
VALUES 
('Hackathon Admin', 'hackadmin@test.com', '$2y$10$92IXUNpkjO0rOQ5byMi.Ye4oKoEa3Ro9llC/.og/at2.uheWG/igi', 1, NOW(), NOW()),
('Track Supervisor', 'tracksupervisor@test.com', '$2y$10$92IXUNpkjO0rOQ5byMi.Ye4oKoEa3Ro9llC/.og/at2.uheWG/igi', NULL, NOW(), NOW());

# Password for both: password
```

### 2. Assign Roles
```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> $hackAdmin = \App\Models\User::where('email', 'hackadmin@test.com')->first();
>>> $hackAdmin->assignRole('hackathon-admin');
>>> 
>>> $trackSuper = \App\Models\User::where('email', 'tracksupervisor@test.com')->first();
>>> $trackSuper->assignRole('track-supervisor');
```

### 3. Access Routes
- **HackathonAdmin Dashboard**: `/hackathon-admin/dashboard`
- **HackathonAdmin Teams**: `/hackathon-admin/teams`
- **HackathonAdmin Ideas**: `/hackathon-admin/ideas`
- **TrackSupervisor Dashboard**: `/track-supervisor/dashboard`
- **TrackSupervisor Teams**: `/track-supervisor/teams`
- **TrackSupervisor Ideas**: `/track-supervisor/ideas`

## 🎯 Key Features

### For HackathonAdmin
- Complete control over one edition
- Manage all teams, ideas, tracks in their edition
- Assign track supervisors
- View edition-wide reports
- Cannot access other editions

### For TrackSupervisor
- Manage teams in assigned tracks
- Review and score ideas from their tracks
- View track-specific reports
- Cannot access other tracks

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Shared Controller Pattern
```php
// Base Controller handles role-based filtering
class TeamController extends Controller {
    protected function applyRoleScope($query, Request $request) {
        // Automatic filtering based on role
    }
}

// Role-specific controllers just extend base
class HackathonAdminTeamController extends TeamController {
    // Inherits all functionality
}
```

### Shared Vue Components
```vue
<!-- Shared page adapts to role -->
<PageHeader 
    :title="viewPrefix === 'HackathonAdmin' ? 'Edition Teams' : 'Track Teams'"
    :description="roleSpecificDescription"
/>
```

## 📊 Database Structure

### Key Relationships
- `users.edition_id` - Links HackathonAdmin to their edition
- `track_supervisors` table - Links supervisors to tracks
- `teams.edition_id` - Scopes teams to editions
- `teams.track_id` - Scopes teams to tracks

## 🎨 UI/UX Consistency
- All pages use theme integration
- Dark mode support throughout
- Responsive design
- Consistent navigation structure
- Role-appropriate statistics and metrics

## 🔐 Security
- Middleware checks role before access
- Controllers verify ownership before CRUD operations
- Scoped queries prevent data leakage
- Permission-based access control

## 📝 Next Steps
1. Test with real user accounts
2. Add more granular permissions if needed
3. Implement export functionality for reports
4. Add activity logging for audit trails

This implementation provides a **scalable, maintainable solution** with **minimal code duplication** while ensuring **proper role-based access control** and **data isolation**.
