### 1.1 Core Business Processes

#### Process 1: Hackathon Lifecycle Management
```yaml
Process Name: Hackathon Edition Management
Process Owner: System Admin
Frequency: Annual
Key Steps:
  1. Edition Creation:
     - Define hackathon year and theme
     - Set registration windows
     - Configure submission deadlines
     - Define evaluation criteria
     
  2. Track Configuration:
     - Create competition tracks
     - Assign supervisors
     - Set team limits
     - Define prizes
     
  3. Timeline Management:
     - Registration period: 30-45 days
     - Idea submission: 15-20 days
     - Review period: 7-10 days
     - Event duration: 2-3 days
     
Business Rules:
  - Each edition must have unique year
  - Minimum 3 tracks per edition
  - Maximum 100 teams per edition
  - Registration must close before idea submission opens
```

#### Process 2: Team Formation & Management
```yaml
Process Name: Team Lifecycle
Process Owner: Team Leader
Duration: Registration to Event End
Key Steps:
  1. Team Creation (Day 1):
     - Leader registers account
     - Creates team with unique name
     - Receives team code
     
  2. Member Recruitment (Days 2-7):
     - Send invitations via email/ID
     - Review join requests
     - Approve/reject members
     - Monitor team size (2-5 members)
     
  3. Team Activation (Day 7+):
     - Minimum 2 members required
     - Team status changes to 'active'
     - Can submit ideas
     
  4. Team Lock (After Submission):
     - No new members allowed
     - No member removal
     - Focus on idea development
     
Critical Success Factors:
  - Quick invitation response (72hr expiry)
  - Clear communication channels
  - Role clarity (leader vs member)
  - Permission management
```

#### Process 3: Idea Submission & Review
```yaml
Process Name: Idea Evaluation Pipeline
Process Owner: Track Supervisor
Duration: 7-14 days
Key Steps:
  1. Submission Phase:
     - Team leader initiates
     - Fills comprehensive form
     - Uploads supporting documents
     - Submits for review
     
  2. Initial Screening:
     - Supervisor assigned automatically
     - Completeness check
     - Eligibility verification
     - Priority assignment
     
  3. Detailed Evaluation:
     - Score four criteria (0-100)
     - Provide written feedback
     - Make decision (accept/reject/edit)
     - Document reasoning
     
  4. Feedback Loop:
     - Notify team of decision
     - If edits needed, specify requirements
     - Allow resubmission (max 3 times)
     - Track all changes in audit log
     
Performance Metrics:
  - Average review time: <48 hours
  - Acceptance rate: 60-70%
  - Resubmission success: 80%
  - Team satisfaction: >4/5
```

```

### 2.2 Critical Data Paths

#### Path 1: User Registration → Team Creation
```
1. User submits registration form
2. System validates email uniqueness
3. System validates national ID
4. Account created with verification token
5. Email sent with verification link
6. User verifies email
7. User creates team (if leader)
8. Team code generated
9. Team record created
10. Leader added as first member
```

#### Path 2: Idea Submission → Review → Decision
```
1. Team leader initiates idea submission
2. Form data validated against rules
3. Files uploaded and scanned
4. Idea saved with 'draft' status
5. Leader submits for review
6. Status changes to 'pending_review'
7. Supervisor notified
8. Supervisor opens idea
9. Supervisor evaluates and scores
10. Decision recorded with feedback
11. Team notified of decision
12. Audit log updated
```
