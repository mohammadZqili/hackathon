| **Settings** | System-wide | Edition-specific |
| **Reports** | Global + All editions | Current edition only |
| **Teams** | All teams | Edition teams |
| **Ideas** | All ideas | Edition ideas |

## 4. Reusability Strategy

### A. Components That Can Be Directly Reused
1. **Vue Components** (90% reusable)
   - Tables with filtering
   - Forms for CRUD operations
   - Statistics cards
   - Charts and graphs
   - QR Scanner component

2. **Backend Logic** (70% reusable)
   - Base controllers can be extended
   - Models are already shared
   - Validation rules
   - Export functionality

### B. Components That Need Modification

#### 1. Controllers - Add Edition Scoping
```php
// SystemAdmin version
public function index() {
    $teams = Team::all();
}

// HackathonAdmin version - needs edition scoping
public function index() {
    $currentEdition = Auth::user()->getCurrentEdition();
    $teams = Team::where('edition_id', $currentEdition->id)->get();
}
```

#### 2. Vue Pages - Add Edition Context
```javascript
// Add edition filter to data queries
props: {
    currentEdition: Object,
    // ... other props
}

// Filter data by edition
computed: {
    filteredTeams() {
        return this.teams.filter(team => team.edition_id === this.currentEdition.id);
    }
}
```

### C. Implementation Plan for Hackathon Admin

#### Phase 1: Core Setup (2-3 hours)
1. **Middleware for Edition Context**
   ```php
   // app/Http/Middleware/SetCurrentEdition.php
   class SetCurrentEdition {
       public function handle($request, $next) {
           $edition = HackathonEdition::current()->first();
           View::share('currentEdition', $edition);
           return $next($request);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Base Controller for Hackathon Admin**
   ```php
   class HackathonAdminBaseController extends Controller {
       protected $currentEdition;
       
       public function __construct() {
           $this->middleware(function ($request, $next) {
               $this->currentEdition = HackathonEdition::current()->first();
               return $next($request);
           });
       }
   }
   ```

#### Phase 2: Adapt Existing Pages (4-5 hours)
1. **Copy SystemAdmin Vue pages to HackathonAdmin**
2. **Add edition filtering to:**
   - Teams Index/Create/Edit
   - Ideas Index/Review
   - Workshops Index/Create/Edit
   - News Index/Create/Edit

3. **Modify Controllers:**
   - Add edition scoping to queries
   - Remove system-wide settings access
   - Add track management methods

#### Phase 3: New Features (3-4 hours)
1. **Track Management**
   - Create Track model and migration
   - CRUD interface for tracks
   - Assign supervisors to tracks

2. **Edition Settings**
   - Registration dates management
   - Submission dates management
   - Edition-specific configuration

3. **Communication Module**
   - Send notifications to teams
   - Schedule meetings
   - Track progress updates

### D. Quick Implementation Steps

1. **Step 1: Create Symbolic Links for Reusable Components**
```bash
# Link common components
ln -s SystemAdmin/components HackathonAdmin/components
```

2. **Step 2: Create Edition-Scoped Controllers**
```php
// Example: HackathonAdmin/TeamController.php
class TeamController extends SystemAdminTeamController {
    protected function getQuery() {
        return parent::getQuery()->where('edition_id', $this->currentEdition->id);
    }
}
```

3. **Step 3: Modify Routes**
```php
// routes/hackathon.php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:hackathon_admin'])->prefix('hackathon-admin')->group(function () {
    // Reuse most SystemAdmin routes but with HackathonAdmin controllers
});
```

## 5. Database Requirements

### New Tables Needed:
1. **tracks** ✅ (Already exists)
   - id, hackathon_edition_id, name, description, supervisor_id

2. **track_supervisors** (Need to create)
   - track_id, user_id

3. **edition_settings** (Need to create)
   - edition_id, key, value

4. **team_communications** (Need to create)
   - id, team_id, sender_id, message, type, sent_at

## 6. Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Inheritance Pattern (Recommended) ⭐
- Create base components in SystemAdmin
- Extend them in HackathonAdmin with edition filtering
- **Pros**: Maximum code reuse, easy maintenance
- **Cons**: Some complexity in setup
- **Time**: 8-10 hours

### Option 2: Duplication with Modification
- Copy all SystemAdmin pages to HackathonAdmin
- Modify each for edition scoping
- **Pros**: Complete independence, easier to customize
- **Cons**: Code duplication, harder maintenance
- **Time**: 12-15 hours

### Option 3: Shared Components with Role Detection
- Use same components but detect role and filter accordingly
- **Pros**: Single codebase, no duplication
- **Cons**: Complex conditionals, potential security issues
- **Time**: 6-8 hours

## 7. Priority Implementation Order

1. **High Priority** (Core Functionality)
   - Dashboard with edition statistics
   - Teams management (edition-scoped)
   - Ideas review and management
   - Track creation and supervisor assignment

2. **Medium Priority** (Enhanced Features)
   - Workshops management
   - News publishing
   - Reports and analytics
   - Communication with teams

3. **Low Priority** (Nice to Have)
   - Twitter integration
   - Advanced analytics
   - Audit logs viewing
   - Bulk operations

## 8. Testing Checklist

- [ ] Hackathon Admin can only see their edition's data
- [ ] Track supervisors can be assigned properly
- [ ] Edition dates can be managed
- [ ] Reports show edition-specific data
- [ ] News is scoped to edition
- [ ] Teams can only register for current edition
- [ ] Ideas are submitted to correct tracks
- [ ] Workshops show for correct edition

## 9. Security Considerations

1. **Middleware Checks**
   - Verify hackathon_admin role
   - Ensure edition ownership
   - Validate track supervisor assignments

2. **Data Scoping**
   - Always filter by edition_id
   - Prevent cross-edition data access
   - Validate user permissions per edition

## 10. Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Create HackathonAdmin structure
php artisan make:controller HackathonAdmin/BaseController
php artisan make:middleware SetCurrentEdition

# Copy and adapt Vue pages
cp -r resources/js/Pages/SystemAdmin/* resources/js/Pages/HackathonAdmin/
# Then modify each file for edition scoping

# Create missing migrations
php artisan make:migration create_track_supervisors_table
php artisan make:migration create_edition_settings_table
php artisan make:migration create_team_communications_table
```

## Summary

**System Admin**: ✅ 90% Complete
- Has most features implemented
- Needs audit log viewing
- Overall working well

**Hackathon Admin**: ⚠️ 30% Complete
- Basic structure exists
- Needs edition scoping throughout
- Missing track management
- Missing communication features

**Recommended Action**: Use **Option 1 (Inheritance Pattern)** to maximize code reuse while maintaining clean separation between roles. Start with high-priority features and incrementally add remaining functionality.

**Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours for core functionality, additional 4-6 hours for complete feature parity.
