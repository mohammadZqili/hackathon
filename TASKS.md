- **Completed**: 2025-09-10 22:50
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed
- **Issue**: "http://localhost:8000/admin/settings - system admin needs access to all admin/* routes and permissions"
- **Root Cause**: UserType enum was using 'admin' but the actual role in database was 'system_admin'
- **Resolution**:
  - Updated UserType::ADMIN enum value from 'admin' to 'system_admin'
  - This ensures HasSuperAdminPrivileges trait correctly identifies system admins
  - System admins now bypass all permission checks via the trait
  - Verified system_admin role has access to all permissions including 'manage-settings'
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/Enums/UserType.php` - Changed ADMIN case value to 'system_admin' (line 7)

- **Issue**: "SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'workshops.edition_id' in 'where clause'"
- **Root Cause**: HackathonEdition model workshops() relationship was using wrong column name 'edition_id' instead of 'hackathon_edition_id'
- **Resolution**:
  - Updated workshops() relationship in HackathonEdition model to use 'hackathon_edition_id'
  - This matches the actual column name in the workshops table
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/Models/HackathonEdition.php` - Fixed workshops() relationship to use correct column (line 64)

#### Task: Add Missing Relationships to HackathonEdition Model
- **Started**: 2025-09-10 22:20

- **Issue**: "SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'start_date' in 'order clause'"

- **Started**: 2025-09-10 22:00

- **Status**: ✅ Fixed
- **Issue**: "Trait method App\Traits\HasSuperAdminPrivileges::hasPermissionTo has not been applied as App\Models\User::hasPermissionTo, because of collision with Spatie\Permission\Traits\HasRoles::hasPermissionTo"
- **Root Cause**: Both HasSuperAdminPrivileges and HasRoles traits define the same methods (hasPermissionTo and hasRole)
- **Resolution**:
  - Used PHP trait conflict resolution syntax in User model
  - Prioritized HasSuperAdminPrivileges methods over HasRoles methods
  - Created aliases for HasRoles methods (hasBasePermissionTo, hasBaseRole)

- **Status**: ✅ Fixed
- **Issue**: "SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'is_submitted' in 'where clause'"
- **Root Cause**: ReportController was using 'is_submitted' boolean field, but Ideas table uses 'status' field with string values
- **Resolution**:
  - Identified that Ideas table uses 'status' field with values: 'draft', 'submitted', 'under_review', etc.
  - Updated queries to use status field correctly
  - Changed `where('is_submitted', true)` to `whereNotIn('status', ['draft'])`
  - Changed `where('is_submitted', false)` to `where('status', 'draft')`
- **Files Modified**:
